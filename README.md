Gmail Draft Creator Workflow
This repository contains a workflow designed to automate the process of classifying incoming emails and drafting automated, professional responses based on their content. The workflow uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently analyze emails and generate context-aware replies.

ðŸš€ How It Works
This workflow operates on a simple, linear process:

Email Ingestion: The workflow is triggered by a new email received in a connected Gmail account.

AI Classification: An LLM classifies the email into a predefined category, such as Sponsorship or High Priority. This step helps route the email to the correct handling process.

AI Response Generation: Based on the classification, the LLM drafts a full email response, including a subject line and a body. The AI is instructed to format this response as a JSON object to ensure clean, structured output.

Data Parsing: A small code node parses the AI's JSON-formatted text output into a usable data object, separating the subject and body.

Draft Creation: The final step uses the parsed data to automatically create a new draft email in the user's Gmail account, ready for review and sending.

âœ¨ Features
Intelligent Classification: Uses a powerful LLM to accurately categorize emails.

Automated Drafting: Generates full email responses with both a subject and a body.

Structured Output: Ensures clean data handling by instructing the AI to output JSON.

Customizable: Easily adaptable to new email categories, different tones, and varied response formats by simply changing the AI's instructions.

ðŸ”§ Getting Started
To use this workflow, you will need to import it into your preferred workflow automation platform (e.g., n8n, Zapier, Make).

Set up the Gmail Trigger: Connect your Gmail account and configure the trigger to watch for new emails.

Configure the LLM: Connect the LLM (e.g., Google Gemini) and provide the system prompts for the AI to follow.

Add the JSON Parsing Node: Include a code node with the provided JavaScript to parse the AI's output.

Connect to the Gmail Node: Use the parsed subject and body from the code node to create the final email draft.
